A small proof of concept game made in my second year of University to explore mental illness, specifically Depression. The goal was to try and communicate to a player that does not suffer from depression, what depression might feel like. The prototype is only about 20 seconds long, but shows off the main mechanics, which were:
- Colour fades from the scene as the "mood" of the player character drops
- Obstacles get harder as the player's mood worsens
